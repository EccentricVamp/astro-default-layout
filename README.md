# Astro Default Layout

An unofficial plugin for [Astro](astro.build) that sets default layouts for Markdown pages.

Based on a [comment](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/397#issuecomment-1264718819) by [mrinestra](https://github.com/mrienstra).

Official support for frontmatter plugins would make this much easier. The [RFC](https://github.com/withastro/rfcs/blob/main/proposals/0022-frontmatter-plugins.md) has been approved, but [the only pull request](https://github.com/withastro/astro/pull/3411) for implementing that RFC has been closed.
